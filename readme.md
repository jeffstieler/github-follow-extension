<h2>Github Follow</h2>

This extension currently:

* adds a *File moved* line and *Folow* button to Comit histories cut short by file movement and;
* changes the *View* button into *Left* and *Right* buttons on diffs that are file movements.

<h4>Commit History</h4>
Clicking the *Follow* button navigates to the commit history prior to the file rename. 

<h4>Diffs</h4>
Clicking the *Left* button will move you to the full file as it existed in its previous location in the parent commit.  Clicking the *Right* button does what the old *View* button did, and moves you to the full file on the current commit.

Please let me know if you have any issues [here](https://github.com/staff0rd/github-follow-extension/issues/new).
