<h2>Github Follow</h2>

This extension will change the *View* button into *Left* and *Right* buttons on diffs that are file movements.

Clicking the *Left* button will move you to the full file as it existed in its previous location in the parent commit.  Clicking the *Right* button does what the old *View* button did, and moves you to the full file on the current commit.

Please let me know if you have any issues [here](https://github.com/staff0rd/github-follow-extension/issues/new).
